# weather-app

### Used API: 
 1. OpenWeather API
 2. GeoDB API

### Used Libraries:
 1. react-select-async-paginate
 2. react-accessible-accordion
 3. MUI

### Purpose: 
 Search and check weather at any specific location (city). Forecast weather of the chosen city for the next seven days.
 APIs used for forecasting are free so the weather information of the next seven days shown in the app is actually consecutive hourly forecasts seperated by 3 hours.  
 The app is built to show how to work with APIs using ReactJS & Typescript.
